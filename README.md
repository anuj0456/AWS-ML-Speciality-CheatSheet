<b> The AWS Machine learning speciality evaluates the candiate primarily in 4 sections</b>
1. Data engineering - 20%
2. Exploratory data analysis - 24% 
3. Modeling - 36%
4. ML implementation & operations - 20%


## Important Tips

1. Read and understand the question before reading answer options (pretend the answer options aren't even there at first).
2. Identify the key phrases and qualifiers in the question.
3. Try to answer the question before even looking at the answer choices, then see if any of those answer choices match your original answer.
4. Eliminate answer options based on what you know about the question, including the key phrases and qualifiers you highlighted earlier.
5. If you still don't know the answer, consider flagging the question and moving on to easier questions. But remember to answer all questions before the time is up on the exam, as there are no penalties for guessing.


<b> As a data scientist you should understand the following nine stages of hierarchy of data:
1. data collection. 
2. reliable data movement from one location to another. 
3. data storage in structured or unstructured databases as per the business requirement.
4. transformation of raw data to remove any data anomalies. 
5. data aggregation from different sources and performs basic analytics. 
6. label the data by performing feature engineering and segregating testing data from cleaning data. 
7. optimize ML algorithms
8. interpret results and improve the algorithms. 
9. implement this AI and deep learning system.


### AWS ML Stack  

The stack for Amazon machine learning has three tiers
